# WalmartSales-SQLProject
Hey there! 👋
Welcome to one of my favorite data projects — where I dive deep into the Walmart retail dataset using good old SQL to uncover real business insights from raw sales data. Think of this like the kind of work a data analyst would do on the job — but I did it solo from scratch!

Project Details:
This project analyzes 1,000 retail transactions from a fictional Walmart store using MySQL Workbench. I use SQL to answer real-world business questions — like which cities generate the most sales, which products are the most profitable, and how customers behave throughout the day.

It’s more than just data crunching — it’s about telling the story behind the numbers.

🔍 Questions I Answered with SQL:

Here are just a few of the questions I tackled:

💰 What’s the total revenue, cost, and profit?

🏙️ Which cities and branches perform best?

👩‍💼 Do men or women spend more, and on what?

⏰ What time of day sees the most sales?

🛍️ Which product categories are most and least profitable?

💳 What’s the most popular way to pay?

And I wrote pure SQL to answer all of this — no dashboards, no Python. Just logic.

🧠 What I Wanted to Learn
1. How to write clean, optimized SQL queries

2. How to translate data into insights (just like in a BI job)

3. How to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends

4. How to present findings in a clear, business-oriented way

✨ What This Project Shows About Me
✅ I can clean and query structured data
✅ I think like a business analyst — not just a coder
✅ I extract real insights that business teams can act on
✅ I write readable, organized SQL with purpose
